# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive community for all contributors. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants and the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Standards

We expect all participants to:

1. **Be Respectful**: Treat everyone with respect, regardless of their background, experience, or opinions.
2. **Be Inclusive**: Welcome diverse perspectives and experiences. Everyone should feel comfortable sharing their ideas.
3. **Be Constructive**: Provide feedback that is helpful, kind, and focused on improvement. Critique the work, not the person.
4. **Be Collaborative**: Work together to achieve common goals, and be open to others' contributions and suggestions.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment, discrimination, or intimidation in any form.
- Offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
- Disruption of discussions, such as excessive messaging or dominating conversations.
- Sharing personal information without consent.
- Engaging in any other behavior that is disrespectful or harmful.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers immediately. You can reach us at [jirayu.s@jirayu.net](mailto:jirayu.s@jirayu.net). All reports will be handled confidentially.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from the project.
